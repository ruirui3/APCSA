Debug the code provided in the starter file so it does the following:

creates two Integer objects x and y, and initializes them as null
prints the values of x and y (should result in the output "null null")
sets x and y to inputs entered by the user
finds the average of the two values and stores this in a Double value avg
prints a sentence as shown in the sample run with the values of x, y and the average
Hint - just as with Strings (see Unit 2: Lesson 1) we can explicitly assign any class-type variable as null just by typing = null

Sample run:

null null
Enter values:
>5
>12
Average of 5 and 12 is 8.5
